# FastArithmetic

FastArithmetic is a small collection of Verilog modules and testbenches, made for educational purposes. Through the various implementation schemes designed, the differences between the different modules in terms of speed, area, and power consumption can be analyzed and conclusions can be drawn regarding what type of arithmetic circuit should be used.
